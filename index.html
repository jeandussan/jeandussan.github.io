i was born and raised until 4 years old in Somerville, New Jersey. when almost reaching 5 years old my family and i moved to pembroke pines Fl. im 21 now and ive lived in the same town since ive moved there. Both my parents are from cali colombia and have lived here in the U.S since theyve been 25. Im a twin but we dont look nothing alike. i have two brothers and two sisters.

My major is graphic and web design but im leaning more towards the graphic design path just because i can see myself more on that side.
